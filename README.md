# clinical_summary
Complete and accurate clinical documentation is crucial for monitoring patient care. Physicians are tasked with documentation of clinic visit, but the traditional methods of a physician manually writing a report have led to their increased workload, reduced interaction time with patients, and a diminished work-life balance.

Therefore, this project employs Huggingface's Falconsai T5 transformer model to summarize clinical patient reports. 
Evaluation is done based on Rouge scores: https://clementbm.github.io/theory/2021/12/23/rouge-bleu-scores.html 

### Dataset
This model is trained on the Huggingface dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/owkin/medical_knowledge_from_extracts.

### Scores
Rouge scores are low as shown below:
|index|rouge1|rouge2|rougeL|rougeLsum|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|falconsai-finetuned|0\.0020408163265306124|0\.0|0\.0020408163265306124|0\.0020408163265306124|

But the summary outputs look correct when evaluated manually. Here are some examples:
#### sample 0
Reference Summary:
{'conditions': 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'interventions': 'Drug: Adalimumab'}

Model Summary:
'conditions': 'Arthritis, Psoriatic', 'interventions'; 'Drug: Adalimumab'

#### sample 5
Reference Summary:
{'conditions': 'Suicide', 'interventions': 'Behavioral: Attachment-Based Family Therapy|Behavioral: Enhanced Usual Care'}

Model Summary:
'conditions': 'Suicidal Ideation|Depression', 'interventions'; 'Behavioral: Attachment Based Family Therapy (ABFT)'

#### sample 10
Reference Summary:
{'conditions': 'Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'interventions': 'Drug: Iodofiltic acid I 123'}

Model Summary:
'conditions': 'Coronary Artery Syndrome|Acute Coronary Syndrome|Chronic Insufficiency', 'interventions'. 'Drug: Iodofiltic Acid I 123'
